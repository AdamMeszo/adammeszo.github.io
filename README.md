# About me

Hi, my name is Adam. I am a freelance software developer based in Slovakia. I decided to create this site to blog about things I like, mainly programming and a little bit about other subjects as well. My tech stack consists mainly of Java, Micronaut, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, Oracle SQL, and PostgreSQL. I also like to play with Bash scripts whenever possible. From the non-programming world, my hobbies include astronomy, sports (running, cycling, ice skating, weight lifting), history, ornithology, and health. I wish you a great reading and feel free to [contact me](#contact) if you find anything here interesting or have an interesting project you'd like to discuss.
